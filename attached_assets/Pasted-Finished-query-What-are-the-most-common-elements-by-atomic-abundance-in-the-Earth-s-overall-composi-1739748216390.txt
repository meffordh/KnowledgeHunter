  reasoning: "The user-provided context indicates there are no relevant findings produced from previous attempts to address the query. Additionally, while some clarifications were obtained (e.g., 'all,' 'any,' 'no'), these are not linked to concrete information sources about the elements found on Earth or their rankings in composition. No sources, data, or analysis have been cited as outcomes, indicating gaps in both coverage and depth. However, some understanding of the user's intent has been established through clarifications, such as focusing on the Earth's overall composition rather than specific environments like the atmosphere. The current progress metrics suggest further exploration is underway but has not yet concluded."
