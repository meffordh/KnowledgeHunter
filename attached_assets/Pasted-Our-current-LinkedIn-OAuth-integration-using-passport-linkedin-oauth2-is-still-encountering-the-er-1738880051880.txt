Our current LinkedIn OAuth integration (using passport-linkedin-oauth2) is still encountering the error:

pgsql
Copy
InternalOAuthError: failed to fetch user profile (status: 403 data: {"serviceErrorCode":100,"message":"Not enough permissions to access: GET /me","status":403})
Since LinkedIn’s API has changed and the patch approach is proving brittle, please switch our authentication flow to use Auth.js with its Express adapter. Auth.js supports over 80 providers—including LinkedIn—and is actively maintained.

Steps:

Install Auth.js Packages:

bash
Copy
npm install @auth/core @auth/express @auth/core/providers/linkedin
Configure Auth.js in our Express App:

Create or update our authentication middleware (for example, in auth.js or authRoute.js) with the following configuration:
js
Copy
import { Auth } from '@auth/express';
import LinkedInProvider from '@auth/core/providers/linkedin';
import express from 'express';
import { storage } from './storage';
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';

const app = express();

app.use(
  '/auth',
  Auth({
    providers: [
      LinkedInProvider({
        clientId: process.env.AUTH_LINKEDIN_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_LINKEDIN_SECRET,
      }),
    ],
    callbacks: {
      async signIn({ user, account, profile }) {
        // Use the returned profile email (ensure scopes include 'email')
        const email = user.email;
        let dbUser = await storage.getUserByEmail(email);
        if (!dbUser) {
          dbUser = await storage.createUser({
            email,
            password: randomBytes(16).toString('hex'),
          });
        }
        return true;
      },
    },
    secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
    session: {
      strategy: 'jwt',
    },
  })
);

// Add a route to get the current user session.
app.get('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return the session's user data.
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 5000'));
Update the Client-Side Login:

Modify the login button (or route) to direct the user to /auth/linkedin for authentication.
Test the Flow:

When a user clicks “Sign in with LinkedIn,” they should be redirected to LinkedIn.
After entering credentials and authorizing, LinkedIn should redirect back to our callback URL, and the Auth.js middleware should process the profile.
The callback should receive a user object with an email (if available), and the signIn callback should store or update the user record in our database.
GET /api/user should return the authenticated user’s data.
Considerations:

If the email is a required field for our application, ensure that your LinkedIn app is configured with the "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" product and that the requested scopes (openid, profile, email) are active.
Auth.js abstracts much of the complexity and has built-in support for handling OAuth state, sessions, and standardized user objects.
