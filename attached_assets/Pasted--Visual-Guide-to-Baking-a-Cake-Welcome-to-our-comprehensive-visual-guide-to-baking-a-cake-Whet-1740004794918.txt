## Step-by-Step Instructions

Below is an in-depth walkthrough of each essential step to ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time.

### 1. Preheat and Prepare

- **Preheat the Oven:** Set the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) at least 15 minutes before starting.
- **Prepare Cake Pans:** Grease pans with butter or non-stick spray and lightly dust with flour, or line them with parchment paper.

*Tip:* It’s important to preheat your oven as a correctly preheated oven ensures even baking—similar to initializing variables correctly in programming[^1].
