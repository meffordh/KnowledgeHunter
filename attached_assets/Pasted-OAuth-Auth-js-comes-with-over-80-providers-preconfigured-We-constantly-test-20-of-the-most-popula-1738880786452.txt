OAuth
Auth.js comes with over 80 providers preconfigured. We constantly test ~20 of the most popular ones, by having them enabled and actively used in our example application. You can choose a provider below to get a walk-through, or find your provider of choice in the sidebar for further details.

LinkedIn
1Register OAuth App in LinkedIn's dashboard
First you have to setup an OAuth application on the LinkedIn developers dashboard.

If you haven’t used OAuth before, you can read the beginners step-by-step guide on how to setup "Sign in with GitHub" with Auth.js.
When registering an OAuth application on LinkedIn, they will all ask you to enter your application’s callback URL. See below for the callback URL you must insert based on your framework.

Callback URL
[origin]/auth/callback/linkedin

Many providers only allow you to register one callback URL at a time. Therefore, if you want to have an active OAuth configuration for development and production environments, you'll need to register a second OAuth app in the LinkedIn dashboard for the other environment(s).
2Setup Environment Variables
Once registered, you should receive a Client ID and Client Secret. Add those in your application environment file:

.env


AUTH_LINKEDIN_ID={CLIENT_ID}
AUTH_LINKEDIN_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
Auth.js will automatically pick up these if formatted like the example above. You can also use a different name for the environment variables if needed, but then you’ll need to pass them to the provider manually.

3Setup Provider
Let’s enable LinkedIn as a sign in option in our Auth.js configuration. You’ll have to import the LinkedIn provider from the package and pass it to the providers array we setup earlier in the Auth.js config file:

We recommend setting up your configuration in /src/routes/plugin@auth.ts file.
/src/routes/plugin@auth.ts


import { QwikAuth$ } from "@auth/qwik"
import LinkedIn from "@auth/qwik/providers/linkedin"

export const { onRequest, useSession, useSignIn, useSignOut } = QwikAuth$({
  providers: [LinkedIn],
}) 
4Add Signin Button
Next, we can add a signin button somewhere in your application like the Navbar. It will trigger Auth.js sign in when clicked.

./components/sign-in.tsx


"use client"

import { signIn } from "next-auth/react"
 
export default function SignIn() {
  return <button onClick={() => signIn("linkedin")}></button>
}
5Ship it!
Click the “Sign in with LinkedIn" button and if all went well, you should be redirected to LinkedIn and once authenticated, redirected back to the app!
