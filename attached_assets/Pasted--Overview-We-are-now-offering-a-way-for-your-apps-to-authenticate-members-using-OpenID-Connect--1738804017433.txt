
Overview
We are now offering a way for your apps to authenticate members using OpenID Connect.

What is OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, enabling applications to authenticate members and obtain lite profile information about the member. OIDC will simplify the partner integration onboarding experience and eliminate dependencies on making additional API calls to find who the authenticated member is.

 Note

Keep in mind Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect does not verify user identities and should not be marketed as such.

Getting Started
Authenticating Members
New members logging in to your service for the first time will need to follow the Authenticating with OAuth 2.0 Guide. When requesting the authorization code in Step 2 of the OAuth 2.0 Guide, make sure you use the OpenID scope openid to get the ID Token. We are also introducing new scopes profile and email.

Permission Name	Description
openid	Required to indicate the application wants to use OIDC to authenticate the member.
profile	Required to retrieve the member's lite profile including their id, name, and profile picture.
email	Required to retrieve the member's email address.
After successful authentication, you will receive the member's access token and ID token.

If your application does not have these permissions provisioned, you can request access through the Developer Portal. Select your app from My Apps, navigate to the Products tab, and request the Sign in with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect product.

Retrieving Member Profiles Using ID Tokens
The primary extension that OIDC adds to OAuth 2.0 is enabling members to be Authenticated using the ID Token data structure. The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the Authentication of a member by an Authorization Server when using a Client, and potentially other requested Claims. The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT). With OIDC, you are now able to extract the member details from the ID Token.

ID Token Payload
Permission Name	Description
iss	The authorization serverâ€™s Identifier of the response https://www.linkedin.com
sub	User identifier
aud	client_id of Relying party/caller Application guarantees user authentication for itself.
iat	ID Token issue time
exp	This is the expiration time of the token. The relying party processing this token should reject it once the expiration time is reached.
Validating ID Tokens
ID Tokens can be validated using the metadata provided by discovery document which contains OAuth endpoints, public keys and claims.

API Request to retreive member details
In addition to the JWT received, you can also call userinfo endpoint to retrieve the member details.

HTTP

GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo
