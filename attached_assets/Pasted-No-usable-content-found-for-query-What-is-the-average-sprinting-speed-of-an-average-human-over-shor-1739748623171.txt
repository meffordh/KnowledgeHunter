Finished query "What is the physiological upper limit for short-distance human sprinting speeds?": { findingsCount: 1, urlsCount: 5, mediaCount: 0 }
Query expansion reasoning: The user's clarified goal is to understand the average short-distance running speed for the general population. The new queries focus on filling gaps about specific values for average speed, comparisons between groups (e.g., general population vs. elite sprinters), and the influence of factors like age, sex, and other variables. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the topic and relevant context.
Generated 5 follow-up queries for "What are the biomechanical or physical factors that impact sprinting speed in humans?"
Query expansion reasoning: Based on the focus on average short-distance running speeds and a general demographic, the queries aim to refine and deepen understanding. Investigating influencing factors, demographic variations (like gender and age), and comparisons (physiological limits and global averages) provides incremental depth and potential correlations for a more comprehensive view of the topic.
Generated 6 follow-up queries for "What is the average sprinting speed of an average human over short distances?"
Query expansion reasoning: The original query did not yield any relevant findings, so follow-up questions refine and expand the scope to better target useful data. Given the clarified context (short distances, general population, just average), the new queries aim to find both broad and nuanced data sources while exploring factors impacting such measurements. Queries also consider data limitations and the possibility of demographic variability, inviting exploration of specific studies or databases.
Generated 5 follow-up queries for "What is the physiological upper limit for short-distance human sprinting speeds?"
Query expansion reasoning: The user's primary interest is the average human running speed over short distances within the general population. Gaps in our knowledge include specific values for general population averages, demographic differences, and underlying factors that contribute to variations in speed. Additional queries were designed to address these details and compare with specific subsets, such as trained athletes or across genders.
Generated 5 follow-up queries for "Do short-distance sprint speeds vary significantly between trained athletes and the general population?"
Query expansion reasoning: The lack of specific findings related to the initial query suggests a need to clarify what aspects of average human running speed should be explored. Diving deeper into factors such as demographic variations, environmental influences, and physiological constraints provides a more comprehensive understanding, while comparison with animals can offer broader context. Both ranges and techniques to optimize speed help address practical and informative angles for the general public.

Research sufficiency check: {
  isComplete: false,
  confidence: 0.65,
  reasoning: 'The user context provides some clarifications about the type of data required (short distances, general population, just average), but the lack of relevant findings in the progress and learnings suggests that no substantial data points or analysis have been found. This indicates an incomplete coverage of key aspects like specific measured averages, sources, or applicable studies detailing average running speeds. Furthermore, the depth of analysis is limited, and no information or references have been cited to substantiate the conclusion or progress toward answering the query.'
}
Suggested next steps: [
  'Search for reputable sources or studies that focus on average short-distance running speeds for the general population.',
  'Calculate or provide context for various averages, e.g., potential ranges for male and female runners in short sprints.',
  'Explore comparisons between trained athletes and general population metrics for a broader perspective.'
