he goal is to reduce the number of individual HTTP requests by batching the image URLs and letting the vision model (via the 4o‑mini model) decide which images are relevant. Then—if needed—you can check dimensions only on the filtered list. This minimizes waiting on thousands of size requests while reusing much of the existing functionality.

1. Locate the Current Image Processing in detectMediaContent()
Current Process:
The function loops through each image URL extracted via regex from the HTML. For each URL, it:

Calls getImageDimensions(imgUrl) to check if the image meets width constraints.
If it passes, then calls analyzeImageWithVision(imgUrl) to determine if the image is useful.
If useful, the image is added to mediaContent.
Issue:
This per‑image processing leads to hundreds or thousands of individual requests for size checking and vision analysis.

2. Modify the Flow to Batch Process the URLs
Goal:
Instead of processing each URL one-by-one, first aggregate all candidate image URLs and then pass the entire array to the vision analysis function. This single call should ask, for example:

“Analyze this set of image URLs and determine which ones could be useful for an article about [the topic].”

Action:

In detectMediaContent(), after you extract the image URLs using your regex, save them into an array (e.g. const imageUrls = [...]).
Remove (or temporarily disable) the individual loop that calls getImageDimensions and analyzeImageWithVision for each URL.
3. Update the Vision Analysis Function
Rename or Create a New Function:
Create a new helper function (e.g. analyzeImagesWithVision(urls: string[]): Promise<AnalyzedImage[]>) or modify the existing analyzeImageWithVision so that it accepts an array of URLs rather than a single URL.

Adjust the API Prompt:
Change the prompt so it instructs the model to analyze an array of image URLs. For example, the system message could be:

typescript
Copy
{
  role: "system",
  content:
    "You are a visual analysis assistant. Analyze the array of image URLs provided by the user and determine for each image if it is useful for an article about the given topic. For each image, return a JSON object with the following keys: 'url' (the original URL), 'isUseful' (a boolean), 'title' (a short descriptive title), and 'description' (a brief description). Respond with a JSON array of such objects. Do not include any extra text.",
}
User Message Example:
The user message can be formatted like:

typescript
Copy
{
  role: "user",
  content: `Analyze the following set of image URLs for an article about "${topic}":\n${JSON.stringify(urls)}`,
}
Expected Response:
The vision model should return a JSON array where each object corresponds to an image URL and indicates if it is useful along with optional title and description.

4. Integrate the Batched Vision Analysis
Call the New Function:
In your updated detectMediaContent():

After collecting all candidate URLs into an array, call your new batched vision analysis function.
Example:
typescript
Copy
const visionResults = await analyzeImagesWithVision(imageUrls);
Filter Results:
Loop through the returned array of analysis results and filter those that have isUseful set to true.

5. (Optional) Post-Process with Dimension Checks
Rationale:
If you still need to enforce size constraints (e.g., width between 400 and 2500 pixels), you can:

For each image in the filtered (useful) list, then call getImageDimensions(url) to verify size.
Only add images to mediaContent if the dimensions meet the criteria.
Example:

typescript
Copy
for (const result of visionResults.filter(r => r.isUseful)) {
  try {
    const dimensions = await getImageDimensions(result.url);
    if (dimensions && dimensions.width >= 400 && dimensions.width <= 2500) {
      mediaContent.push({
        type: "image",
        url: result.url,
        title: result.title,
        description: result.description,
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing image dimensions for", result.url, error);
  }
}
Alternatively, if the vision model’s output is trusted, you can skip the dimension check altogether.

6. Update Documentation & Test
Documentation:
Update inline comments to describe that you’re now batching image URL analysis with the vision model and optionally filtering by dimensions afterward.

Testing:

Test with a known HTML output from Firecrawl that returns many image URLs.
Confirm that the batched vision analysis returns a filtered list.
Validate that the final mediaContent only includes images that are marked as useful (and, if applicable, meet the dimension requirements).
Rationale Summary
Performance Improvement:
By batching the vision analysis, you reduce the overhead of multiple HTTP requests and processing delays.

Reuse Existing Functionality:
The trimming process and the current AI integration are still used; you’re only modifying the order of operations and how many calls are made.

Scalability:
Handling images in batches is far more scalable, especially when firecrawl returns thousands of URLs.

Simplicity:
The overall code change is minimal: you’re simply aggregating URLs, modifying one function’s input (to accept an array), and filtering the results—without a complete rewrite of your logic.
