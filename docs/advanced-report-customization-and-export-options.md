Advanced Report Customization & Export Options
Overview
The Advanced Report Customization & Export Options feature extends ResearchHunter’s deep research capabilities by giving users the flexibility to tailor the final research report to their specific needs. Users will be able to choose from multiple report templates, adjust formatting (including citation styles, section ordering, and additional metadata), and export the report in various formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) with properly rendered citations and source links. This empowers researchers and professionals to produce polished, publication-ready reports that meet diverse presentation standards.

Objectives
Enhance Customization: Enable users to modify report layouts and styles according to their preferences (template, citation style, section order, and metadata).
Multi-format Export: Provide reliable export functionality to multiple common formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) while preserving formatting and interactive elements (where applicable).
Improve Usability: Offer a preview mechanism so users can see their customizations in real time and adjust settings before final export.
Maintain Consistency: Ensure that citation styles and source links are rendered correctly across export formats, meeting academic or professional standards.
Core Features
Template Selection:

A UI component to let users choose from a library of predefined report templates.
Option to upload custom templates (if desired in later phases).
Formatting Adjustments:

Citation Styles: Choose from popular citation formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) via a dropdown.
Section Ordering: Drag-and-drop interface or a simple reordering tool to adjust section order (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Findings, Conclusions).
Additional Metadata: Options to include or exclude metadata such as author name, report date, keywords, and custom notes.
Export Options:

Export the final report in PDF, DOCX, or HTML.
Each export format should preserve the user’s formatting choices:
PDF: Consistent pagination, headers/footers, and embedded fonts.
DOCX: Retained styles and editable content for future modifications.
HTML: Responsive design with interactive source links and citation popovers.
Preview & Feedback:

A live preview pane that updates as users adjust customization settings.
Options to toggle individual customization layers (e.g., citation style preview, section reorder preview).
Citation & Source Links:

Ensure that all citations in the report are properly formatted.
Automatically generate and embed source URLs next to citations where available.
User Flow
Accessing the Customization Interface:

After the research process completes and the initial report is generated, users see a “Customize Report” button on the report view.
Clicking the button opens a customization sidebar/modal.
Customizing the Report:

Template Picker: Users select a template from a grid/list of preview thumbnails.
Formatting Options: Users choose a citation style (via a dropdown), adjust section order (using drag-and-drop or up/down buttons), and toggle metadata fields (checkboxes for author, date, keywords, etc.).
Preview Pane: A real‑time preview displays how the report will look with the current settings.
Exporting:

Users select an export format (PDF, DOCX, HTML) via radio buttons or a dropdown.
Once satisfied, users click “Export Report.” This sends a request to the backend to generate and return the formatted file.
A download link or auto-download is provided once export is complete.
Technical Requirements
Frontend
Framework: React with TypeScript.
UI Libraries: Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling.
State Management: React Query for asynchronous export requests and global state management.
Customization UI: Components for drag-and-drop section reordering, dropdowns for citation style, and toggles for metadata fields.
Live Preview: Render the report preview using either a document viewer component or an embedded iframe that refreshes based on user changes.
Backend
Server Framework: Node.js with Express.
Document Generation:
Utilize a document conversion library (e.g., Pandoc, wkhtmltopdf, or a dedicated DOCX generator) to produce PDF, DOCX, and HTML outputs.
Integrate with existing report-generation modules to apply the user’s customizations.
API Endpoints:
Customization Options API: Fetch available templates, citation styles, and metadata configuration options.
Export API: Accept customization parameters (template ID, citation style, section order, metadata options, desired output format) and return the final document.
Security & Performance:
Ensure exports are processed asynchronously with progress notifications.
Validate user input and file size limitations to prevent overloading the server.
Integration
Data Mapping: Map the internal report data to the customizable template fields.
Formatting Engine: Leverage a conversion engine to apply styling and formatting rules, ensuring that the final export matches the preview.
Citations: Integrate with an existing citation management system to pull and format references properly.

The AI agent responsible for building this feature should:

Data Collection & Research:

Gather current best practices for document customization and multi-format export (drawing from sources such as Pandoc’s User Guide, Microsoft Word template customization, and similar export tools).
Identify any existing libraries or APIs (both frontend and backend) that can be leveraged for generating PDF, DOCX, and HTML documents.
UI Component Generation:

Create React components for the customization sidebar/modal that include:
A TemplatePicker component displaying available report templates.
A CitationStyleSelector (dropdown with popular citation formats).
A SectionReorder component (e.g., using drag-and-drop).
Toggle controls for metadata inclusion.
A LivePreview component to render the customized report.
Backend API Development:

Develop Express API endpoints:
GET /api/customization/options: Return available templates, citation styles, and metadata options.
POST /api/export/report: Accept customization parameters (template ID, formatting choices, export format) and return the generated document.
Integrate with a document conversion engine (e.g., Pandoc or similar) to format and export the report based on the provided customizations.
Integration & Testing:

Ensure the frontend customization settings map correctly to backend export options.
Implement error handling to catch and report any conversion failures.
Write unit tests for the new components and API endpoints.
Perform integration tests ensuring the exported documents are formatted as expected.
Documentation:

Document the new feature in the project’s developer documentation.
Include usage examples and screenshots of the customization interface and export process.
Deployment:

Ensure feature toggles are in place to enable/disable advanced customization in production.
Monitor performance and user feedback post-deployment to iterate further.
